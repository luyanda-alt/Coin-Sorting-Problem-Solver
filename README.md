# Coin Sorting Problem Solver

## Overview
This project solves a coin-sorting problem using an AI search algorithm. The main goal is to sort coins into different circles based on specific rules, utilizing state management and priority queues. The program features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and visualization.

## Features
* **State Management:** Represents the problem as different states, tracking the positions of coins and moves made.
* **Search Algorithm:** Utilizes a priority queue to efficiently search for the optimal solution to the coin sorting problem.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with tkinter to allow users to visualize and interact with the sorting process.
* **Valid Moves and Goal Checking:** Implements rules to ensure valid moves and to check when the goal state is achieved.

## How to Use
Run the Program: Execute the script to launch the GUI.
Interact with the Interface: Use the GUI to input initial configurations and see the solution process in action.
View Results: The program will display the steps taken to solve the problem.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
tkinter (for GUI)
heapq (for priority queue management)
collections.deque (for state management)
Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies if they are not already available.
Run the Coin Sorting Problem Solver.py script to launch the application.

## Example
To see the coin-sorting problem solver in action, you can just run the script and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your coin-sorting scenario.
